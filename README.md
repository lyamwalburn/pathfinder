# pathfinder
project to demonstrate different pathfinding algorithms. 

Initial setup with customizeable grid size, choice of start/ end point and walls.

Walls can be placed by clicking and dragging accross the grid
End point can be chosen by right click on grid or via input box
Start point can be chosen by shift right click on grid or via input box

A* Algorithm following - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm#Pseudocode
set with a hueristic using Euclidean distance as diagonals are permitted

TODO:
[] Different Algorithms to compare against one another
[X] Maze Generation to create random mazes for the algorithms to traverse
[] Error messaging should no path be avaliable 
[] Better styling
